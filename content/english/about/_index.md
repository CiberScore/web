In our mission to transform cybersecurity, we combine innovation, accessibility and an approach focused on the needs of SMEs.

We operate from the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería Informática, where we combine academic knowledge with practical experience to develop advanced, scalable and affordable solutions.

Our working model is hybrid, combining physical presence in a leading research environment with the flexibility of online work. This allows us to adapt to our clients' needs and offer them continuous support through digital platforms.

Our proposition:

- Advanced automation: IoT technology for always-on security.
- Accessibility: A SaaS model that reduces costs and democratizes cybersecurity.
- Scalability and customization: We adapt our solutions to each business, regardless of its size.

We are more than a cybersecurity company; we are the ally that makes protecting your business simple, effective and affordable.
